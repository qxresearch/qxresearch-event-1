This repository is only the project version of this course : [Computational Thinking : Python](https://xiaowuc2.vercel.app/posts/computational-thinking-python) 

I am a Machine Learning Researcher, currently working in IBM with expertise in solving real-world problems through coding. Taught 20,000+ students & working professionals to crack coding interviews and land their dream job TCS, Walmart, Accenture, Cognizant. My research has been recognized through publications in esteemed journals such as Springer[^1] and O'Reilly[^2].
